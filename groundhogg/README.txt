## ü™ì Ax the "Success Tax"

Other SaaS (Software as a Service) CRM platforms will charge you more as your list grows.

**But not us!**

When using the Groundhogg CRM & Marketing Automation suite free or with any of our paid plans, _we'll never charge you more_!

### üö´ There are *no limits* on:

* Number of contacts
* Number of funnels or automations
* Number of emails sent

When using Groundhogg CRM & Marketing Automation you will **never** be limited on the amount of **anything**! Unlike [other SaaS platforms](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/).

Businesses [save $1,000s a year](https://groundhogg.io/pricing/) after switching to Groundhogg.

## üíΩ You own your data!

The reality of SaaS CRMs is that you pay, and pay, and pay, and you invest all this money into a system to help your business thrive, but it can be taken away at a moments notice.

Putting your data in a SaaS CRM is like renting an apartment, but with less protection and stingier landlords. You can get evicted at any time, for any reason. There is no recourse.

This leaves your business exposed. What would happen to your business if your CRM was turned off?

With Groundhogg you actually [own your data](https://www.groundhogg.io/learn/email-and-self-hosting-is-now-more-critical-than-ever/)! No one expect you can make impactful changes.
